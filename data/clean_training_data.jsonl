When you create an object, you specify the key name. For example, on the Amazon S3\nconsole\nThe object key name consists of a sequence of Unicode characters encoded in UTF-8, with a maximum length of 1,024 bytes or approximately 1,024 Latin characters. In some locales, a single character may require 2 bytes for encoding. When naming your objects, be aware of the following:\n-\nObject key names are case sensitive.\n-\nObject key names include any prefixes (known as folders in the console). For example,\nDevelopment/Projects.xls\nis the full object key name of theProjects.xls\nobject located within theDevelopment\nprefix (or folder). The prefix, the delimiter (/\n), and the name of the object are included in the 1,024 byte limitation for the object key name. For more information about prefixes and folders, see Choosing object key names. -\nCertain characters might require special handling when they're used in object key names. For more information, see Object key naming guidelines.\nNote\nObject key names with the value \"soap\"\naren't supported for virtual-hosted-style requests. For object key name values where\n\"soap\"\nis used, a path-style\nURL must be used instead.\nChoosing object key names\nThe Amazon S3 data model is a flat structure: You create a bucket, and the bucket stores objects. There is no hierarchy of subbuckets or subfolders. However, you can infer logical hierarchy using key name prefixes and delimiters as the Amazon S3 console does. The Amazon S3 console supports a concept of folders. For more information about how to edit metadata from the Amazon S3 console, see Editing object metadata in the Amazon S3 console.\nSuppose that your bucket (admin-created\n) has four objects with the\nfollowing object keys:\nDevelopment/Projects.xls\nFinance/statement1.pdf\nPrivate/taxdocument.pdf\ns3-dg.pdf\nThe console uses the key name prefixes (Development/\n,\nFinance/\n, and Private/\n) and delimiter\n(/\n) to present a folder structure. The s3-dg.pdf\nkey doesn't contain a slash-delimited prefix, so its object appears directly at the root level of the\nbucket. If you open the Development/\nfolder, you see the\nProjects.xlsx\nobject in it.\nAmazon S3 supports buckets and objects, and there is no hierarchy. However, by using prefixes and delimiters in an object key name, the Amazon S3 console and the AWS SDKs can infer hierarchy and introduce the concept of folders.\nThe Amazon S3 console implements folder object creation by creating a zero-byte object with the folder prefix and delimiter value as the key. These folder objects don't appear in the console. Otherwise they behave like any other objects and can be viewed and manipulated through the REST API, AWS CLI, and AWS SDKs.\nObject key naming guidelines\nYou can use any UTF-8 character in an object key name. However, using certain characters in key names can cause problems with some applications and protocols. The following guidelines help you maximize compliance with DNS, web-safe characters, XML parsers, and other APIs.\nSafe characters\nThe following character sets are generally safe for use in key names:\n| Alphanumeric characters |\n|\n| Special characters |\n|\nThe following are examples of valid object key names:\n-\n4my-organization\n-\nmy.great_photos-2014/jan/myvacation.jpg\n-\nvideos/2014/birthday/video1.wmv\nNote\nIf you use the Amazon S3 console to download objects that have key names that end with periods\n(.\n), the periods are removed from the ends of the key names of\nthe downloaded objects. To retain periods at the ends of key names in downloaded\nobjects, you must use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), AWS SDKs, or Amazon S3 REST\nAPI.\nIn addition, be aware of the following prefix limitations:\n-\nObjects with a prefix of\n./\nmust be uploaded or downloaded with the AWS CLI, AWS SDKs, or REST API. You can't use the Amazon S3 console to upload these objects. -\nObject keys that contain relative path elements (for example,\n../\n) are valid if, when parsed left-to-right, the cumulative count of relative path segments never exceeds the number of non-relative path elements encountered. This rule applies to all requests made by using the Amazon S3 console, Amazon S3 REST API, AWS CLI, and AWS SDKs.For example:\nvideos/2014/../../video1.wmv\nis valid.videos/../../video1.wmv\nisn't valid.videos/../../2014/video1.wmv\nisn't valid.\nPeriod-only path segments\nObject keys containing period-only path segments (.\nor ..\n)\ncan cause unexpected behavior when processed by applications, SDKs, or tools that interpret\nthese as relative path references.\nThe following patterns can cause issues:\n-\nfolder/./file.txt\n- Contains current directory reference -\nfolder/../file.txt\n- Contains parent directory reference -\n./file.txt\n- Starts with current directory reference -\n../file.txt\n- Starts with parent directory reference\nThe following patterns work normally:\n-\nfolder/.hidden/file.txt\n- Period is part of filename, not standalone -\nfolder/..backup/file.txt\n- Periods are part of filename, not standalone\nWhen applications process object keys with period-only segments, the following behavioral impacts can occur:\n-\nPath normalization - Many systems automatically resolve\n.\nand..\nreferences, potentially changing the effective path (for example,folder/./file.txt\nbecomesfolder/file.txt\n) -\nAccess issues - Applications might fail to locate objects due to path resolution differences\n-\nInconsistent behavior - Different tools and SDKs might handle these patterns differently\nImportant\nTo avoid these issues, we recommend avoiding period-only path segments in object key names. Use alternative naming conventions for organizational purposes.\nCharacters that might require special handling\nThe following characters in a key name might require additional code handling and most likely must be URL encoded or referenced as HEX. Some of these characters are non-printable characters that your browser might not handle, which also require special handling:\n-\nAmpersand (\n&\n) -\nDollar sign (\n$\n) -\nASCII character ranges 00\u20131F hex (0\u201331 decimal) and 7F (127 decimal)\n-\nAt symbol (\n@\n) -\nEqual sign (\n=\n) -\nSemicolon (\n;\n) -\nForward slash (\n/\n) -\nColon (\n:\n) -\nPlus sign (\n+\n) -\nSpace \u2013 Significant sequences of spaces might be lost in some cases (especially multiple spaces)\n-\nComma (\n,\n) -\nQuestion mark (\n?\n)\nCharacters to avoid\nWe recommend not using the following characters in a key name because of significant special character handling, which isn't consistent across all applications:\n-\nBackslash (\n\\\n) -\nLeft brace (\n{\n) -\nNon-printable ASCII characters (128\u2013255 decimal characters)\n-\nCaret or circumflex (\n^\n) -\nRight brace (\n}\n) -\nPercent character (\n%\n) -\nGrave accent or backtick (\n`\n) -\nRight bracket (\n]\n) -\nQuotation mark (\n\"\n) -\nGreater than sign (\n>\n) -\nLeft bracket (\n[\n) -\nTilde (\n~\n) -\nLess than sign (\n<\n) -\nPound sign (\n#\n) -\nVertical bar or pipe (\n|\n)\nXML-related object key constraints\nAs specified by the XML standard on end-of-line handling\nThe following is a list of such special characters and their equivalent XML entity codes:\nApostrophe (\n'\n) must be replaced with'\nQuotation mark (\n\"\n) must be replaced with\"\nAmpersand (\n&\n) must be replaced with&\nLess than sign (\n<\n) must be replaced with<\nGreater than sign (\n>\n) must be replaced with>\nCarriage return (\n\\r\n) must be replaced with\nor\r\nNewline (\n\\n\n) must be replaced with\nor"}
